# Project 2
UCI Boot Camp Project 02 - Food Inventory
Collaborators: Maxx Sanner, Jonathan Hui, Michael Trujillo, and Fernando Donoso

This was the Second project for the full stack web development program at UC Irvine, in which the goal was to build an interactive application that:


- Must be interactive (i.e: accept and respond to user input)
- Use at least one new third-party API
- Must have a polished UI
- Must meet good quality coding standards
- Must be deployed to Heroku App

# Purpose
The intention behind this project was to build an application designed to help the average consumer keep track of their groceries that they have at home. Whether it be in their fridge, pantry, or freezer this app keeps track of it all! 

# How to use: 
In order to use this application you must click on the create item button. This will allow you to enter in all the details of your food item and also allow you to sort it. If you want to view if it was added into the correct place click on either the fridge, freezer, or pantry option to see that your item was successfully added to the right location. If you happen to mistype any of the information you can go ahead to the area that you sorted it into and dynamically update the item information by click on it. There is also a tutorial section that will show you how to add items!
